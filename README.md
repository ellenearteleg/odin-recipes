First project for The Odin Project

Hello! Thank you for checking out my project.

This is my solution to the Recipes Project, the first project out of many projects in The Odin Project.

Here are a few things to note before taking a deep dive into it. 

1. This is not mobile responsive at all. You will probably cringe and cry when you view this on a mobile or a different screen iteration at your dekstop device. 

2. My goal for this was to be able to design and code a project that, and continously improve it as I go progess through The Odin Project curicculum, (This is the first project on the Foundations learning path) so responsiveness wasn't much of a concern to me at all.

3. All photos are grabbed from Pexels and Unsplash. I will update this and give proper attribution.

4. This is a two paged website. I have made it in a way so that there's some interaction and interactivity, but it is rather limited to what HTML and CSS can offer.

5. I did not completely follow the brief from TOP but tried to create my own take if I were to make it a whole project.

6. That's all. Thank you.
